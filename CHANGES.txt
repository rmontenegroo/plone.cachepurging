Changelog
=========

1.0.8 (2015-06-09)
------------------

- correctly be able to purge empty path(root of site). Previously, /
  was always appended to url so one potential path of the resource
  in varnish would never get purged--sometimes the most important, the homepage.

  [elro]

1.0.2 (2011-08-31)
------------------

  [vincentfretin]


1.0.1 - 2011-05-21
------------------

- Register a `zope.testing.cleanup.addCleanUp` function to stop all purge
  threads. Also make the default purger available as a module global, so the
  cleanup function can get to it after the ZCA has been torn down.
  [hannosch]

- Register an atexit handler to stop the purge thread on process shutdown.
  [hannosch]

- Change the reconnect strategy for the purge thread to retry fewer times and
  assume a permanent connection failure after one minute and stop the thread.
  This allows the application process to shutdown cleanly without the purge
  thread being stuck forever.
  [hannosch]

- Update socket connection code for the purge thread to use Python 2.6 support
  for passing in a timeout to the create_connection call.
  [hannosch]

- Disable `purge queue is full` warning in debug mode, where it spammed the
  console.
  [hannosch]

- Correct license and update distribution metadata.
  [hannosch]

  extra.
  [esteele]

-------------------

- Fix rewriting of paths in a virtual hosting environment, so that the path passed
  to the rewriter is actually used instead of always the current request path.
  [davisagli]
